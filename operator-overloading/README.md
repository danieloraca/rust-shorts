## Point Struct with Addition and Display Traits

This Rust code defines a `Point` struct with `x` and `y` coordinates. 
It implements the `Add` trait to allow addition of two `Point` instances, resulting in a new `Point`. 
The `fmt::Display` trait is also implemented to format and display the result as `"Diff: P.x = {}; P.y = {}"` in a user-friendly way. 
In the `main` function, two points are added, and the result is printed to the console.

This is a basic example of operator overloading.
